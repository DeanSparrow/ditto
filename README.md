### Coding Standards
If you're using [JetBrains'](https://www.jetbrains.com/) [PhpStorm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm),
you can just import settings from the 
[`.idea/` directory](https://github.com/Zbee/ditto/blob/master/.idea).

Otherwise, just use common sense,
copy existing code snippets,
CRLF line endings,
2 spaces for indentation,
and 80 characters as the maximum character length in a line (excluding JSON files).
